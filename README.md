# (Unofficial) Tinyurl wrapper

This is a **very** simple wrapper for [tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/) written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The main reason I did this is for learning how to write programs in rust, which seems a really nice programming language.

## How to install

I’ll put the binaries in the [release](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/tinyurl/releases) section. Just download from there.

If you want to build from source just clone the repo and run `cargo build`.

## Usage

Usage is really simple:

```
tinyurl "https://example.com/this-is-a-very-long-url-that-is-tedious-to-write"
```

And you’ll have your short url as output.
